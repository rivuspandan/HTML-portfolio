<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there. I'm just a kid pretending I know things and for some reason it's working. Life didn't give me choice so here I am.
  but hey I learned what opening and closing tags are. Plus I can turn a picture into a link that takes you to a different page so yeah
  I'm learning. I'm not a coding wizard or techy(yet).
</p>

<p>Enough yapping. Hope you like the website I made or maybe don't doesn't matter I completed the project and output matches the goal.png 
  And yeah there are no bugs only extraordinary features hello_world("print")
</p>
